# Creating A Flask Application for a Machine Learning Model.

In the code files above we take a machine learning model which we have built and create a Flask Application in order to make the machine learning model more applicable with no need to deal with code simply providing inputs in a web page which we design in index.html.

It's important to note that even though the files are given in the order above it is NECESSARY in order for the Flask Application to run to put the index.html file inside a templates folder. 
The templates folder should sit in the same directory as the rest of the code files and inside it the index.html file.

The project is done under a course in Ariel University Department of Industrial Engineering.
